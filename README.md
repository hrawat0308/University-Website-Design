# University Website

This is a Eduford University Website design. I have created this website using HTML, CSS , CSS-Grid, CSS-Flex.

This website mainly contains 4 Web Pages:

* Index.html : Home Page
* contact.html : Contact Us Page
* course.html : Courses Page
* about.html : About Us Page






## WHY this project was chosen?

This is a simple prototype of a University Webpage with no dynamic functionality and is built using only HTML and CSS, CSS-GRID and Flexbox.

This project is selected just for practice and educational purpose. 

## HOW did you make the project?

I've used HTML to structure the website. CSS to style the website and CSS-GRID and Flexbox to layout the website.

Below is the link to this website which is hosted using Netlify :

## WHAT features, technical things you had implemented?

The website loads the Home page. The home page consist a banner image on the top, which includes the Logo and the navigation links. The second section in home page shows the courses offered by the university. The third section is the Global Campus section, which also consist of a smaller banner image. The last section is a footer in all web page, which includes social media links.

Similarly, the About us page consist of corresponding infomation. Courses web page consist a grid section with some images and other information.

The contact us page includes a form to contact the university, the form doesn't function and no other button functions in this website as it is just a design of a website.

Website is made responsive with the help of CSS Media Queries.
